# Evaluation of sql injection (sqli) attack detection strategies in web applications using machine learning
 This repository contains the code developed for the degree work “Evaluation of SQL Injection Attacks Detection Strategies in Web Applications using Machine Learning” done by Santiago Taborda Echeverri to obtain the degree of Telecommunications Engineer from the Universidad de Antioquia.

## Description
The objective of this project is to evaluate various strategies for detecting SQL injection attacks (SQLi) in web applications using machine learning techniques. The techniques implemented include Naïve Bayes, logistic regression, random forests and One-Class Support Vector Machine (One-Class SVM).

The project involves the integration of public data from the “SQL Injection Dataset” available in Kaggle with data processed by AizoOn Technology Consulting's web application firewall (Due to the confidentiality of the company's data, the structured database is not made public). The code ranges from data preprocessing and feature generation to hyperparameter tuning and model performance evaluation. 

## Results
The evaluation of the machine learning models showed that logistic regression is the most effective technique for detecting SQL injection attacks for this use case, achieving an accuracy and F1-Score of 99.45%.
